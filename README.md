# WGANMonetGeneration
Continuation of MonetGAN Project, here I implement the WGAN architecture in order to generate brand new Monet Paintings from random noise

The notebook file was larger than GitHub's allowed file size so I've included a compressed archive of the notebook instead. To properly view the animation of generated results visit the original Kaggle Kernel here: https://www.kaggle.com/arham23/wganmonetgeneration

Please leave me some feedback on the code!
